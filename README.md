### The Credit Risk Classification is a model that was trained and evaluated for it's accuracy in identifying the credit worthiness of borrowers froom the data 
### in the lending_csv file.

#### The scikit-library was paramount for the develpment of the machine learning model in python. 
#### The "import train_test_split" was used to create the testing subsets and training subsets of the dataset provided from the csv_file.
#### The "import LogisticRegression" was used for it's simplicity in finding the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular class.
#### Iin order to evauluate the model the "import confusion_matrix, classification_report" were used to first create a confusion matrix to summarize the correct and incorrect predictions of the model and generate a classification report to show the metrics of precision, recall, F1-score and support.
